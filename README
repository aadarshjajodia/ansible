This project is aimed at doing some customizations on VM's that are provisioned using VMWare.
The customizations are:
1. Installing some dependencies which might be needed in the customizations below.
2. Adding users to the VM
3. Regenrating SSH keys.
4. Changing Hostname of the VM

Current Dependencies:
1. Pip on the remote machine
2. Passlib on the client(where ansible is running)

How to use this:

This repository contains a hosts file which lists all the hosts where we want this ansible script on.
The structure of the hosts file is:
<vm_ip_address> ansible_ssh_pass=<vm_sudo_password> ansible_ssh_user=<vm_username> ansible_become=true

For each new VM, all the 4 values specified above in the hosts file needs to be added at the end of the hosts file.

For running the script use the following command:
ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts --ask-sudo-pass
